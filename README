This is a simple support vector machine implementation based on the
primal form of SVMs for linearly separable problems, and problems that
also require slack variables. I used Bishop's PRML text as a basis for
this implementation. This is meant as a guide for the basic ideas
behind support vector machiens. The CVXOPT library is used for solving
the quadratic program at the heart of the SVM.
